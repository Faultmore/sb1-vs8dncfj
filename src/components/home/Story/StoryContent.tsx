        Coastal State Roleplay is a premier roleplaying community utilizing the FiveM
        platform. Our community as a whole was founded nearly 5 years ago during the
        Grand Theft Auto V era. We are a community with a strict foundation on realistic,
        serious, and dedicated roleplay.

        Coastal State Roleplay brings the best of the best from a completely custom vehicle
        fleet, uniforms to include custom belts, sirens, a near 1:1 replica of a real life MDC
        system, and proper lingo and policies. All crafted by our in-house development team.
